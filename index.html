                <h2>The Optical Networks Group (ONG) at UCL’s Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, 
                    led by TRANSNET Director Professor Polina Bayvel, has unveiled groundbreaking research using machine learning to revolutionise optical network performance. 
                    </h2>
<br>
            
                <p>Their study, published in <i>APL Machine Learning</i> by the American Institute of Physics, introduces Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) as a transformative approach to modelling maximum achievable throughput in optical networks.
                    <p>Traditionally, calculating network throughput involves computationally intensive methods such as Integer Linear Programming (ILP) or heuristics. 
                        These techniques, while accurate, lack scalability for large networks.</p> 
                        <p>The ONG’s innovative use of MPNNs addresses this challenge by leveraging geometric deep learning to predict throughput trends with exceptional accuracy and vastly reduced computation times.</p>

                <p>The study highlights how MPNNs, trained on diverse datasets, can learn the relationships between network topology, node and edge features, and throughput potential. </p> 
                   <p>When compared to ILP solutions, MPNNs deliver results much faster for smaller networks (10–15 nodes) and significantly outperform heuristic methods for larger networks (25–100 nodes). </p>
                    <p>A potential game changer in the world of data communication network infrastructure, as ONG’s work has been key in the development of optical fibre communication networks, <a href="https://transnet.org.uk/index.php/news-and-events/617-optical-networks-group-shortlisted-as-bhattacharya-award-finalist"> carrying over 95% of all digital data that underpin global communications.</a> </p>

                <p>Despite these achievements, our researchers note that MPNNs require further refinement to generalize effectively across vastly different network structures. 
                    Expanding training datasets to include more varied topologies and traffic patterns will be key to unlocking their full potential.</p>

                <p>
                    By combining advanced computational techniques with ONG’s expertise in optical fibre systems, 
                    this research reinforces TRANSNET’s commitment to pioneering the future of digital communication infrastructure.
